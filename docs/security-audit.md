## Summary

Baseline WordPress hygiene is strong:

- **Input** is read as `sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_POST[...] ) )`
  everywhere a superglobal is touched.
- **Output** is escaped for context — `esc_html()` / `esc_attr()` on the admin
  page, and `wp_kses()` with the `OpenPortePlugin::$html_espace_allowed_tags`
  whitelist for every rendered widget.
- **Admin settings** go through the WordPress Settings API, which enforces the
  capability (`manage_options`) and the `options.php` nonce on save; every
  registered option has a `sanitize_callback`.
- **Direct access** is blocked by an `ABSPATH` (or `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN`) guard
  in every PHP file.
- **Crypto** uses `random_bytes()` / `random_int()` for secrets and the PoW
  secret number, and `hash_equals()` for constant-time HMAC comparison.
- The single direct DB query (uninstall cleanup) uses `$wpdb->prepare()` with
  `$wpdb->esc_like()`.

No SQL injection, stored/reflected XSS, missing-capability, or broken-nonce
issues were found. The substantive weaknesses are in the **challenge-verification
logic**; the rest are low-severity hardening items.

## Findings

### 1. Solved tokens are not single-use (replay) — Medium — Mitigated (1.29.0)

**Type:** Replay attack / anti-automation bypass.
**Location:** `includes/core.php`, `verify()` → `verify_solution()` (and the
`verify_server_signature()` path).

**The weakness (through 1.28.1).** `verify_solution()` validates the algorithm,
the challenge hash, the HMAC signature, and — when the salt carries an
`?expires=` parameter — the expiry. It kept **no record of which solutions had
already been accepted**. The same base64 `altcha` payload therefore verified
successfully on every submission until it expired. With the default expiry of
5 minutes (300 s since 1.28.0; 1 hour before that) — and "None" (`0`) meaning
never — a bot could solve one proof-of-work and then replay that single token
across unlimited submissions, defeating the anti-spam purpose.

> Note: the 1.26.3 changelog entry "Fixed possible replay attacks via salt
> splicing" refers to a narrower salt-parsing bug, not to one-time-use.

**The fix (1.29.0).** `verify()` became a stateful policy wrapper around the two
stateless primitives, which keep doing pure cryptography. It adds two layers:

- a **per-request memo**, keyed both on the submitted bytes and on the verified
  signature, so one submission costs one use even when it is verified twice in
  the same request (the dual `authenticate` registration in `wordpress.php` /
  `woocommerce.php`) and even when the JSON envelope is re-encoded in between;
- an **atomic reuse counter**, keyed on the token's HMAC-verified `signature`
  and bounded by the new **Replay limit** setting (`openporte_replaylimit`,
  default **5**, `0` = unlimited).

Three properties make the bound hold rather than merely exist:

1. **Atomic — by design, and as of 1.29.0 verified only by design.** A
   read-then-write counter loses updates under exactly the parallel burst a
   replay produces, so the bound would break precisely when it is needed. With
   a persistent object cache the counter is a `wp_cache_incr()`; otherwise it is
   one guarded `UPDATE … WHERE CAST(option_value AS UNSIGNED) < limit` that
   InnoDB row-locks, so the check and the increment cannot be separated by
   another worker. The first claim is a guarded `INSERT IGNORE` against
   `wp_options`' `UNIQUE KEY option_name`, deliberately *not* `add_option()` —
   core implements that as `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` behind a cached
   existence check, so two concurrent workers can both believe they created the
   row.

   **State of verification.** This is a reasoned argument, checked link by link
   in the v1.29.0 acceptance record, not a measured result: neither test suite
   can produce genuine concurrency (one is single-process against a fake
   `$wpdb`, the other runs a single worker by design). Its one environmental
   assumption *was* checked on the bench (WordPress 7.1, MariaDB 11.8.8):
   `wp_options` is InnoDB and carries `UNIQUE KEY option_name`, which is what
   makes the first-use `INSERT IGNORE` an atomic create and the guarded
   `UPDATE` row-locked. What remains unproven is the behaviour of the whole
   under load — a design argument catches a wrong shape; only parallel workers
   catch a wrong assumption. The parallel-replay test that would measure it is
   deferred to issue #102; until it lands, do not read this section as evidence
   that atomicity has been demonstrated under concurrency.
2. **Keyed on a verified field.** The signature is HMAC-checked before the
   counter is touched, so it is neither forgeable nor sensitive to how the JSON
   envelope happens to be encoded — unlike the raw payload, which a replay can
   re-encode at will.
3. **Lifetime = the token's own remaining validity** (60 s floor, no ceiling),
   read through the shared `payload_expires()` helper that also feeds the crypto
   gate. Because the counter dies with the token and never before it, an
   expiring token is bounded to N uses over its *whole life*, not N uses per
   rolling window.

The counter lives in transient-shaped `wp_options` rows, so WordPress's own
garbage collection reclaims it — no schema, no cron. It is written **only after
full cryptographic success**, so junk, forged and expired tokens never create
state and the open REST challenge endpoint stays stateless (finding #5 is
unaffected).

**Custom-backend ("GateCHA") mode is covered by the same mechanism.** This also
closes a gap that was never recorded here: OpenPorte verifies custom-backend
tokens **locally**, with `verify_solution()` and the shared secret — it makes no
server-to-server verify call — so a custom backend's own replay protection, if
it has any, never applied to OpenPorte's form endpoints. Enforcement sits
*after* the dispatch in `verify()`, keyed on the `signature` both payload shapes
carry, so self-hosted, custom and server-signature tokens are all bounded by
OpenPorte-owned state, with no dependency on the backend being stateful and no
protocol change. A custom backend **should** still set `expires` in the salt it
serves, so that the crypto gate and the counter's lifetime both bound the token;
the settings-page health check now warns when it does not.

**Why bounded reuse and not strict single-use.** Strict single-use carries a
real false-rejection risk: when a submission fails for an unrelated reason
("username already taken", a missing field) and the visitor resubmits, the
still-valid token would be rejected as a replay unless the widget re-solves on
re-render — which it usually does, but not in every configuration. A default of
5 keeps those resubmissions working while cutting amplification from unbounded
to five. This is a **deliberate deviation from upstream ALTCHA**, whose v2
"Next" plugin keeps a strict used-challenge registry. The trade-off is revisited
once the widget can re-solve after a replay rejection (visitor-recovery UX,
issue #103) — that is the prerequisite for lowering the default toward strict.

**Residual risk — the arithmetic.** The bound is real, not absolute:

- **Amplification equals the configured limit** (default 5). One solved
  proof-of-work buys five submissions, not one.
- **Fail-open on a broken store.** If the counter cannot be written the
  submission is accepted, degrading to pre-1.29 behaviour. Deliberate — a store
  outage must not lock visitors out — and observable: the plugin fires
  `openporte_replay_store_unavailable` and reports recent episodes on the
  settings page.
- **Per-node / per-site caches don't share counters.** APCu, or a node-local
  Redis, gives each node its own budget, multiplying the effective limit by the
  node count. A shared object cache, or the database path, does not.
- **Direct calls to the primitives bypass it.** `verify_solution()` and
  `verify_server_signature()` remain public and stateless; both are now
  deprecated for direct use (`_deprecated_function`, removal scheduled for 2.0),
  and `verify()` is the sole supported entry point.
- **Tokens with no expiry get a window, not a lifetime.** A self-hosted expiry
  of `0` ("None"), or a custom backend that omits `expires` from the salt,
  leaves nothing to track, so the counter falls back to a 4-hour window that
  resets: N uses per 4 h — a slow drip rather than the previous unbounded burst.
  The `0` case closes for good when "None" is removed (issue #103); the
  custom-backend case is detected at the endpoint health check and escalates to
  an operator-chosen policy in the same release.
- **`replaylimit = 0` switches the counter off.** It is the documented escape
  hatch for a site that genuinely needs the old stateless behaviour, and the
  settings page warns for as long as it is set.

**Invariant to preserve (CVE-2025-68113).** The counter's lifetime is derived
from `expires`, so `expires` must stay bound by the signature: the signature
covers the challenge, the challenge covers the salt, and `expires` lives in the
salt — editing it breaks the challenge hash. The trailing `&` that
`generate_challenge()` appends terminates the query string, so a crafted secret
number cannot splice an extra parameter onto it. Never sign anything the
challenge does not cover, and never drop that delimiter. Both are pinned by
regression tests in `tests/phpunit/VerifyPrimitivesTest.php`.

**Not a mitigation: Verification Delay.** The `openporte_delay` setting is
emitted only as a client-side widget attribute; the widget applies it as a
browser `setTimeout` *before* it fetches and solves the challenge, and **no PHP
path sleeps** (there is no `sleep`/`usleep` anywhere in the plugin, and
`verify()` never reads the setting). A replayed token is a bare HTTP POST — the
widget JS never runs, so there is nothing to skip — and a bot that solves the
proof-of-work itself bypasses it just as completely. It is a perception knob,
not defence in depth: **never count it toward this finding.**

### 2. Server-signature verification skips `expire` / `verified` — Medium — Fixed

**Type:** Replay / weakened verification (custom-backend / spam-filter mode).
**Location:** `includes/core.php`, `verify_server_signature()`.

When a `custom` backend returns a server-signed payload, the original code
verified only the HMAC signature and then returned `true` whenever
`classification !== 'BAD'`. It did **not** check the `expire` timestamp or the
`verified` flag carried in `verificationData`. Two consequences:

1. **No expiry** — a captured server-signed payload is accepted forever (replay),
   even though the proof-of-work path (`verify_solution()`) already enforces
   expiry. The ALTCHA reference implementation requires
   `verified === true && expire > now`.
2. **`verified` ignored** — a payload the backend explicitly marked *not* verified
   would still be accepted as long as `classification` was not the literal `BAD`.

Additionally, reading `$this->spamfilter_result['classification']` without an
`isset()` guard emits a PHP warning and fails open (treats a missing
classification as "not BAD") when the key is absent.

**Fix applied.** After the HMAC check passes, parse `verificationData` and:

- reject when `expire` is present, numeric, and in the past;
- reject when `verified` is present and falsy (`''`, `0`, `false`, `no`);
- guard the `classification` read with `isset()`.

The `expire` / `verified` checks are **defensive (only-when-present)** so a
minimal custom backend that omits those fields is not broken, while the
reference backend (which sends both) gets the stricter behaviour. The
load-bearing raw-binary `true` flag on `hash('sha256', …, true)` is preserved
(removing it breaks all verification — see `AGENTS.md`).

```php
public function verify_server_signature($payload, $hmac_key = null)
{
  if ($hmac_key === null) {
    $hmac_key = $this->get_secret();
  }
  $data = $this->decode_payload($payload);
  // Guard the payload shape before touching properties (see finding #3).
  if ($data === null || !isset($data->algorithm, $data->verificationData, $data->signature)) {
    return false;
  }
  $alg_ok = ($data->algorithm === 'SHA-256');
  // The raw-binary (true) flag is load-bearing; removing it breaks verification.
  $calculated_hash = hash('sha256', $data->verificationData, true);
  $calculated_signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $calculated_hash, $hmac_key);
  // hash_equals: constant-time comparison so the HMAC can't be recovered via timing.
  if (!($alg_ok && hash_equals($calculated_signature, $data->signature))) {
    return false;
  }
  $this->spamfilter_result = array();
  parse_str($data->verificationData, $this->spamfilter_result);
  // Mirror verify_solution() and the ALTCHA reference (verified === true &&
  // expire > now). Checked only when the backend supplies the field, so minimal
  // custom backends that omit them keep working.
  if (isset($this->spamfilter_result['expire'])) {
    $expire = intval($this->spamfilter_result['expire'], 10);
    if ($expire > 0 && $expire < time()) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  if (isset($this->spamfilter_result['verified'])) {
    $verified_flag = strtolower((string) $this->spamfilter_result['verified']);
    if (in_array($verified_flag, array('', '0', 'false', 'no'), true)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return !isset($this->spamfilter_result['classification'])
    || $this->spamfilter_result['classification'] !== 'BAD';
}
```

**Since 1.28.0.** The remediation above is still in force — the `expire` and
`verified` checks, which are what this finding is about, are unchanged. The
snippet itself shows the 1.27.2 code and has since drifted in two ways, neither
of which weakens the fix: the digest is no longer hardcoded (`get_algorithm()`
and `hash_ident()` now supply it, so a site can run SHA-384/512), and the
spam-filter plumbing is gone (#6) — `$this->spamfilter_result` is a local
`$verification` array and the trailing `classification !== 'BAD'` return became
a plain `return true`. `verify_server_signature()` in `includes/core.php` is the
current reference.

---

### 3. Decoded payload not validated before use — Low — Fixed

**Type:** Input validation / robustness.
**Location:** `includes/core.php`, `verify()`, `verify_solution()`,
`verify_server_signature()`.

The verification methods decoded the submitted token as
`json_decode( base64_decode( $payload ) )` and then read properties
(`$data->algorithm`, `$data->salt`, …) without checking that decoding produced a
valid object. A non-base64 or non-JSON `altcha` value yields `false` / `null`,
so every property access emits a PHP warning ("Attempt to read property … on
null"). The result still fails closed, but the warnings pollute the log and, on
strict configurations, can interfere with output.

**Fix applied.** A private `decode_payload()` helper performs strict decoding;
`verify()` dispatches only on a valid object, and each sub-method guards the
properties it needs with `isset()` so it stays self-contained when called
directly.

```php
private function decode_payload($payload)
{
  if (!is_string($payload) || $payload === '') {
    return null;
  }
  $decoded = base64_decode($payload, true); // strict: reject non-base64 input
  if ($decoded === false) {
    return null;
  }
  $data = json_decode($decoded);
  if (json_last_error() !== JSON_ERROR_NONE || !is_object($data)) {
    return null;
  }
  return $data;
}
```

`verify_solution()` gains
`if ($data === null || !isset($data->algorithm, $data->salt, $data->number, $data->challenge, $data->signature)) { return false; }`
at the top; `verify_server_signature()` gains the equivalent guard shown in
finding #2. Behaviour on valid payloads is unchanged; malformed input still
fails closed, now without warnings.

---

### 4. Broken `autocomplete` attribute on settings inputs — Low — Fixed

**Type:** Information exposure / WordPress best practice.
**Location:** `admin/options.php`, `openporte_settings_field_callback()`.

The shared settings-field `<input>` carried `autcomplete="none"` — a misspelling
of `autocomplete`, so the intended autocomplete suppression never took effect.
Because the same callback renders the **Signing secret** field as a plain text
input with its value pre-filled, browsers and password managers could capture
and re-offer the HMAC signing secret.

**Fix applied.** Correct the attribute to `autocomplete="off"`. (The field
remains `type="text"`: the admin needs to read and copy the secret, and the
value is only ever exposed on the `manage_options`-gated settings page. The
plaintext-in-DB aspect is finding #7.)

```php
<input autocomplete="off" class="regular-text" ...>
```

---

### 5. No rate limiting on the public challenge endpoint — Low — Accepted

**Type:** Denial of service / abuse.
**Location:** `includes/core.php`, the `rest_api_init` route with
`permission_callback => '__return_true'`, and `openporte_generate_challenge_endpoint()`.

`GET /wp-json/openporte/v1/challenge` (and the deprecated `altcha/v1` alias) is
unauthenticated and uncapped. Each call runs `random_int()` plus a couple of
hashes and returns a fresh signed challenge.

**Decision — Accepted, not fixed.** The endpoint *must* be publicly reachable
for the CAPTCHA to function. The usual mitigation, per-IP throttling via
transients, would require reading `REMOTE_ADDR` and so conflicts with the
plugin's explicit "collects no visitor IP address" privacy promise (see
`docs/architecture.md` → Privacy stance). The per-request cost is low and
proof-of-work already prevents forging a *valid* solution, so the residual risk
is generic request-flooding, best handled at the web-server / WAF / caching
layer rather than in-plugin. Operators who need it can rate-limit the route
upstream.

---

### 6. No HTTPS enforcement on the custom challenge URL — Info — Accepted

**Type:** Man-in-the-middle (operator-controlled configuration).
**Location:** `includes/core.php`, `get_challengeurl()`; the
`openporte_api_custom_url` option (sanitised by `openporte_sanitize_challenge_url()`
with `esc_url_raw()`, which permits `http://`).

In `custom` mode the operator supplies the challenge backend URL. It is not
forced to HTTPS, so a misconfigured `http://` backend would expose challenges
and solutions in transit.

**Decision — Accepted, not fixed.** The value is set by an administrator, not a
visitor, and forcing HTTPS would break legitimate local/development backends
(`http://localhost`, container hostnames). A future UI hint recommending HTTPS
is preferable to a hard block. `esc_url_raw()` already strips dangerous schemes
(e.g. `javascript:`), so there is no injection vector — only a configuration
recommendation.

---

### 7. Signing secret stored in plaintext in `wp_options` — Info — Accepted

**Type:** Hardening / defence in depth.
**Location:** activation (`openporte_activate()`), `OpenPortePlugin::$option_secret`.

The HMAC signing secret is stored unencrypted in `wp_options`. A database
compromise lets an attacker forge valid challenges and solutions.

**Decision — Accepted.** This is standard for WordPress plugins that need a
server-side secret available on every request; there is no materially better
store without a custom encryption-key-management scheme, and the key itself
would still have to live somewhere readable by PHP. The secret is generated with
`random_bytes()`, never sent to the frontend, and is only displayed on the
`manage_options`-gated settings page. Accepted as residual risk.

---

### 8. Form handlers add no nonce of their own — Info — Accepted

**Type:** CSRF (by design).
**Location:** all `integrations/*` POST handlers (each annotated with
`// phpcs:ignore WordPress.Security.NonceVerification.Missing`).

The integration handlers read `$_POST['altcha']` (or `openporte_register`)
without verifying a nonce of their own.

**Decision — Accepted, by design.** Each handler hooks into the host flow's own
processing (`register_post`, `authenticate`, `preprocess_comment`,
`wpcf7_spam`, Gravity Forms / Elementor / Formidable field validation, …), which
already performs that plugin's CSRF handling. The OpenPorte payload is itself an
unforgeable, HMAC-signed anti-automation token — adding a separate nonce would
be redundant and, for the public login/register/comment flows, is not how
WordPress core gates those endpoints. The dispatch reads are presence/value
checks only and are fully sanitised.

---

### 9. HMAC signing key is 96-bit entropy — Low — Fixed

**Type:** Cryptographic strength / defence in depth (OWASP A02).
**Location:** `includes/core.php`, `random_secret()` (used to seed
`OpenPortePlugin::$option_secret` at activation).

`random_secret()` returns `bin2hex(random_bytes(12))` — 12 random bytes, i.e.
**96 bits of entropy**, rendered as a 24-character hex HMAC key. The CSPRNG
(`random_bytes`) is correct, but for HMAC-SHA256 the modern minimum is 128 bits
(256 ideal). 96 bits is not practically brute-forceable, so this is hardening,
not an exploitable weakness.

**Fix applied.** `random_secret()` now returns `bin2hex(random_bytes(32))`
(256-bit). Because the secret is generated only when absent (`add_option` is a
no-op when set), existing installs keep their current key and previously issued
challenges keep verifying — only fresh installs get the stronger key.

---

### 10. Formidable autoloader regex does not block path separators — Low — Fixed

**Type:** Path traversal / file inclusion (theoretical) (OWASP A03).
**Location:** `integrations/formidable.php`, `openporte_forms_autoloader()`.

```php
if ( ! preg_match( '/^OpenPorte.+$/', $class_name ) ) { return; }
$filepath = dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/formidable/' . $class_name . '.php';
if ( file_exists( $filepath ) ) { require( $filepath ); }
```

The `.+` in the guard matches any character, including `/`, `\` and `.`, so the
class name is concatenated into the include path without a path-separator check.
This is **not practically exploitable** — the value is a PHP class name supplied
by the autoload mechanism, not by request input, and PHP class names cannot
contain `/` — but it is looser than necessary.

**Fix applied.** The guard is now `^OpenPorte[A-Za-z0-9_]+$`, which rejects path
separators and dots before the class name is concatenated into the include path.

---

### 11. Unused dead code from the removed paid-SaaS path — Info — Fixed

**Type:** Attack surface / maintainability (OWASP A04 Insecure Design).
**Location:** `includes/core.php` — `flatten_post()`, `sanitize_data()`,
`remove_private_keys()`.

These public methods are defined but never called anywhere in the plugin
(confirmed by grep). They are leftovers from the removed paid-SaaS classifier,
which flattened and POSTed form data to the external API. Dead code is not a
vulnerability, but removing unreachable code shrinks the attack surface and the
maintenance burden.

**Fix applied.** The three methods were deleted. Minor caveat: they were
`public`, so third-party code could in theory have called them — unlikely, but
worth a changelog note when this ships in a release.

### 12. Inline-script JSON not hardened against `</script>` breakout — Info — Fixed

**Type:** Cross-site scripting (defence in depth).
**Location:** `integrations/custom.php`, the `wp_add_inline_script()` that exposes
`window.OPENPORTE_WIDGET_ATTRS`.

The widget attributes were encoded with `wp_json_encode()` (no flags) and printed
verbatim inside a `<script>` block. `wp_json_encode()` does not escape `<`, `>` or
`&`, so a value containing the literal `</script>` would close the script element
early and allow HTML injection.

**Not exploitable in practice:** every attribute is admin- or developer-supplied
(`challengeurl` passes through `esc_url_raw()`, which strips `<`/`>`; `strings`
comes from translations; `name` is a code literal), with no visitor-controlled
path. Recorded as defence in depth.

**Fix applied.** Encode with the script-context flags so the output cannot break
out of the `<script>` element:

```php
$attrs = wp_json_encode(
  $plugin->get_widget_attrs($mode),
  JSON_HEX_TAG | JSON_HEX_AMP | JSON_HEX_APOS | JSON_HEX_QUOT
);
```

## Appendix C — Coding-standards tooling (WPCS)

A `phpcs.xml.dist` ruleset and a `PHPCS` GitHub workflow run the WordPress
Coding Standards, scoped to **security and correctness** (the `WordPress.Security`,
`WordPress.DB`, `WordPress.WP`, `WordPress.PHP`, `WordPress.NamingConventions.PrefixAllGlobals`
and `WordPress.WP.I18n` rule groups) plus `PHPCompatibilityWP` (`testVersion 8.0-`).
Whole-file formatting sniffs (Yoda conditions, indentation) are intentionally
excluded — the code base inherits ALTCHA's two-space style and reformatting is out
of scope. The `base64` "obfuscation" warnings are excluded because ALTCHA payloads
are legitimately `base64(JSON)`.

The first clean run surfaced and fixed three low-risk correctness items (none a
vulnerability):

- **Loose `in_array()`** in `has_active_integrations()` and the settings select
  callback → now strict (`in_array( …, true )`). (The method has since been
  rewritten to use `array_filter()` during the spam-filter removal, and
  deprecated in 1.28.0 — see #62.)
- **File-scope globals `$plugin` / `$mode`** in `integrations/elementor.php` (and
  the equivalent hook-closure locals in `integrations/wpmembers.php`) shadowed
  WordPress's admin globals of the same name → renamed to `$openporte_plugin` /
  `$openporte_mode`.
- **"Wordpress" misspelling** corrected to "WordPress" in two comments and two

## Appendix A — WordPress Plugin Security Guidelines coverage

Mapped against <https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/>.

| Guideline | Status | Evidence |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Sanitize inputs | Pass | `sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( … ) )` on every `$_POST` read; no `$_GET`/`$_REQUEST`/`$_COOKIE`/`$_SERVER` reads (grep-confirmed) |
| Validate data | Pass (hardened) | Token validation added in finding #3; every `register_setting` has a `sanitize_callback` |
| Escape output | Pass | `esc_html()`/`esc_attr()` on admin pages; `wp_kses()` with the `$html_espace_allowed_tags` whitelist for all widget HTML |
| Nonces / CSRF | Pass / by design | Save path uses the Settings API nonce; public form handlers delegate to the host flow (finding #8) |
| Capability checks | Pass | `add_options_page( …, 'manage_options', … )`; Settings API enforces the cap on save; comment handler skips for `manage_options` |
| Avoid direct file access | Pass | `ABSPATH` (or `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN`) guard at the top of every PHP file |
| Prepared SQL | Pass | Only direct query is `uninstall.php`, using `$wpdb->prepare()` + `$wpdb->esc_like()` |
| Secure REST endpoints | Pass (permissive by design) | `permission_callback` present; intentionally public for challenge generation (finding #5) |
| No dynamic file inclusion from input | Pass | All `require`/`include` are static literals; the one variable include is the guarded Formidable autoloader (finding #10) |
| No `eval`/`system`/`unserialize`/`extract` | Pass | grep-confirmed absent |
| Don't trust proxy/`$_SERVER` headers | Pass | No `$_SERVER` reads; `get_ip_address()` removed in 1.27.0 |

## Appendix B — OWASP coverage

OWASP Top 10 (2021):

| Category | Status | Notes |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| A01 Broken Access Control | Pass | Admin gated by `manage_options`; the only public surface (challenge REST) is intentional and exposes no secret |
| A02 Cryptographic Failures | Pass (note) | `random_bytes`/`random_int` CSPRNG, HMAC-SHA256, constant-time `hash_equals`; key length is finding #9 |
| A03 Injection | Pass | SQL prepared; no command/code injection sinks; output escaped; autoloader note in finding #10 |
| A04 Insecure Design | Pass (note) | Stateless-PoW replay is **bounded since 1.29.0** (finding #1) — an atomic reuse counter in `verify()`, with the residuals recorded there; dead code in finding #11 |
| A05 Security Misconfiguration | Pass (note) | Secure defaults; no debug output; PoW complexity has no seeded default → falls to the 100–10000 range (consider defaulting to medium/high) |
| A06 Vulnerable & Outdated Components | Monitor | Vendored `public/altcha.min.js` (widget 2.3.0) — track upstream advisories on re-vendor |
| A07 Identification & Auth Failures | Pass | Delegates to WP/WooCommerce auth; adds an anti-automation layer, does not weaken auth |
| A08 Software & Data Integrity Failures | Pass | Uses `json_decode` (not `unserialize`); submitted tokens are HMAC-signed and verified |
| A09 Security Logging & Monitoring | Note | No built-in logging; operators can hook the `openporte_verify_result` action |
| A10 SSRF | Pass (note) | One server-side fetch, added in 1.28.0: the custom-endpoint health check `wp_remote_get()`s the configured Challenge URL (`admin/healthcheck.php`). Operator-supplied (`manage_options`), never visitor-supplied, and only on OpenPorte's own settings screen. Deliberately **not** `wp_safe_remote_get()` — private-network backends (a LAN host or NAS running e.g. GateCHA) are a primary use case that the "safe" variant blocks. No other `wp_remote_*`/`file_get_contents`/cURL of an external URL (grep-confirmed) |

OWASP PHP cheat-sheet spot checks:

- **Type juggling:** security-critical comparisons use strict `===` (algorithm,
  challenge) and `hash_equals` (signatures); the `verified` check uses
  `in_array( …, true )`. No loose `==` in a security decision. The challenge
  digest moves to `hash_equals` in v1.29.0 for uniformity — see Appendix D and
  [#84](https://github.com/jcberthon/openporte/issues/84).
- **Error handling / info leak:** finding #3 removes the PHP warnings that junk
  tokens used to emit, reducing noise/leak in logs.
- **File uploads / sessions:** none — the plugin handles no uploads and sets no
  cookies/sessions.

## Appendix D — External advisory cross-check: SecuPress, ALTCHA v2 ≤ 2.2 (2025-12-03)

On 2025-12-03 SecuPress published nine findings against **Altcha GDPR Compliant
Captcha and Bot Protection ≤ 2.2**
(<https://secupress.me/blog/altcha-2-2-multiple-vulnerabilities/>).

**Scope note, and the reason most rows below read "N/A":** that advisory targets
the **closed-source v2** product from altcha-org, which is a different code line
from the open-source v1.x plugin OpenPorte forked. Seven of the nine findings
describe subsystems v2 added and v1 never had — a license check, an "under
attack" mode, IP bypass lists, cookie exceptions, `get_edk()`, `rate_limit()`,
and the `includes/admin/actions.php` admin-AJAX surface. "N/A" here means *this
code does not exist in OpenPorte*, not *we looked and it was fine*. Only findings
5 and 6 touch logic the two lines share by ancestry; both were already fixed
independently in this audit before the advisory was read.

| # | SecuPress finding (v2 ≤ 2.2) | OpenPorte | Evidence |
| - | --------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1 | IDOR — no nonce in `includes/admin/actions.php` | N/A | No `wp_ajax_*`/`admin_post_*` handler exists (grep-confirmed). Admin writes go through the Settings API — `settings_fields( 'openporte_options' )` in `admin/options.php` supplies the `options.php` nonce, and the page is registered with `manage_options` in `includes/admin.php` |
| 2–4 | 3× CSRF on the "set" functions | N/A | Same absent surface. The settings involved (license, IP bypass, cookie exceptions, under-attack) do not exist here |
| 5 | Timing side-channel — `===` instead of `hash_equals()` | **Fixed** | `hash_equals` guards every HMAC comparison: `verify_server_signature()` and `verify_solution()` in `includes/core.php`, plus the health check in `admin/healthcheck.php`. See the note below on the remaining non-secret `===` |
| 6 | Insufficient entropy #1 — 12-byte (96-bit) secret | **Fixed** — finding #9 | `random_secret()` is `bin2hex( random_bytes( 32 ) )`. Independently found and fixed here before the advisory was read. Residual for upgraded installs: see the closing note |
| 7 | Insufficient entropy #2 — `get_edk()` predictable IP/UA hash | N/A | No such function, and no IP- or UA-derived identifier anywhere: the plugin reads no `$_SERVER` at all |
| 8 | Race condition — non-atomic transient `rate_limit()` | N/A | No rate limiter exists to race. See the note below on the adjacent live item |
| 9 | IP spoofing via `X-Forwarded-For` | N/A | `get_ip_address()` was removed in the 1.27.0 paid-SaaS removal; no `$_SERVER`, `REMOTE_ADDR` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` read remains (grep-confirmed, Appendix A) |

Two points recorded so a future reader does not re-open them from the table
alone:

- **The remaining `===` is not finding 5.** `verify_solution()` still compares
  the challenge digest with `===` (`$data->challenge === $calculated_challenge`),
  as does the `$data->algorithm` label check. Neither operand is secret — both
  are recomputable by the submitter from the `salt` and `number` carried in
  their own token — so nothing leaks through the comparison's timing. The
  digest comparison is nonetheless moving to `hash_equals` for uniformity in
  v1.29.0, tracked in
  [#84](https://github.com/jcberthon/openporte/issues/84); the algorithm label
  stays `===`, being a public identifier rather than a digest.
- **Finding 8's impact does not transfer.** OpenPorte's unauthenticated
  challenge endpoint is a DoS/abuse surface (finding #5, accepted), not a
  verification bypass: there is no rate limit for a parallel request to defeat,
  and issuing extra challenges grants nothing — each still has to be solved and
  its HMAC verified. Per-IP throttling remains rejected on privacy grounds.
  **Its *lesson* did transfer, though:** a non-atomic transient counter is
  exactly what v1.29.0's replay counter must not be, and is why that counter is
  a cache `INCR` or a single row-locked `UPDATE` rather than a
  read-check-write (finding #1).

**CVE-2025-68113 (ALTCHA salt splicing) — cross-check.**

| Advisory | OpenPorte | Evidence |
| -------- | --------- | -------- |
| CVE-2025-68113 — a solved token's `expires` could be edited because the salt's query string was not terminated, letting a crafted secret number splice a later expiry onto it | **Not affected** — and now pinned | `generate_challenge()` appends a trailing `&` to the salt, terminating the query string, and `expires` lives inside the salt that the challenge hashes and the signature covers: editing it breaks the challenge digest. The invariant is documented at the code and pinned by `tests/phpunit/VerifyPrimitivesTest.php` (`test_editing_the_salt_expiry_breaks_the_challenge`, `test_appending_a_parameter_to_the_salt_breaks_the_challenge`) so a future refactor cannot quietly undo it |

This matters more since 1.29.0 than it did before: the replay counter's lifetime
is derived from `expires`, so a token whose expiry could be forged forward would
also carry its reuse budget forward.

**Residual on finding 6.** The 256-bit key seeds *new* installs only:
`add_option()` is a no-op once the row exists, so a site upgraded from ALTCHA
1.x or early OpenPorte still holds its original 96-bit secret. That is
deliberate — silently rotating would fail every challenge issued in the
preceding expiry window. The remedy is a manual one, tracked in
[#70](https://github.com/jcberthon/openporte/issues/70) (Copy/Regenerate actions
on the Shared Secret field, v1.29.0). 96 bits is not practically
brute-forceable, so this is hardening rather than exposure.

## Maintainer decisions on record

- **Finding 1 (replay / one-time-use) — reversed in v1.29.0.** Through 1.28.1
  this was an accepted limitation: no behavioural change, to avoid the
  resubmission false-rejection risk. v1.29.0 fixes it with *bounded* reuse
  rather than strict single-use, which is what resolves that objection — a
  default of 5 leaves room for a visitor to resubmit after an unrelated form
  error while cutting amplification from unbounded to five. Three further calls
  on record:
  - **Atomic from the first release.** An earlier draft shipped a non-atomic
    transient counter in 1.29.0 and made it atomic in 1.29.1. Rejected: the
    lost-update window is precisely the parallel burst a replay attack
    produces, so a non-atomic counter would fail exactly when it mattered.
  - **Expiry stays advisory in 1.29.0.** `0` ("None") and values under 60 s are
    warned about, not rejected or migrated. Safe to do because the counter now
    bounds replay independently of the expiry; hard bounds are a breaking-config
    change and belong to [#103](https://github.com/jcberthon/openporte/issues/103).
  - **Local, never delegated.** Replay protection is OpenPorte-local even in
    custom-backend mode. Delegating it would mean calling the backend's verify
    API at submit time — something the plugin does not do today — and is a
    separate release ([#104](https://github.com/jcberthon/openporte/issues/104)).
    A bare "Off" is deliberately not offered: an operator who disabled local
    protection believing the backend covered it would have none at all.
- **Finding 5 (REST rate limiting):** documented as accepted risk; per-IP
  throttling rejected because it conflicts with the no-visitor-IP privacy
  promise. Handle upstream if needed.
- **SecuPress ALTCHA v2 advisory (reviewed 2026-07-28):** cross-checked in
  Appendix D. No plugin code change required — the two applicable findings were
  already fixed, the other seven target v2-only code. The legacy 96-bit secret
  on upgraded installs is not auto-rotated; admins get a manual Regenerate
  action instead ([#70](https://github.com/jcberthon/openporte/issues/70)). The
  non-secret challenge `===` is tracked separately as uniformity work
  ([#84](https://github.com/jcberthon/openporte/issues/84)), not as a security
  fix.
