# OpenPorte E2E suite

Browser-driven tests against a running wp-env bench. Two spec files, two axes:

- **`settings-matrix.spec.js`** — **integrations × auto-verification mode ×
  Floating UI**, so combinations too numerous to click through by hand get
  exercised automatically. Born from the wpDiscuz `auto="onsubmit"` race
  (submission AJAX winning against the proof-of-work solve).
- **`replay-limit.spec.js`** — what happens when the *same* solved token is
  submitted again (issue #101).

## The settings matrix (`settings-matrix.spec.js`)

Per integration driver it runs:

- **8 acceptance combos** — auto ∈ {disabled, onload, onfocus, onsubmit} ×
  floating ∈ {off, on}: fill the form, solve (pre-solve where the mode allows,
  submit-triggered for onsubmit/floating — the race paths), submit, assert the
  submission was accepted.
- **2 negative controls** — the server must reject both:
  - *missing token*: strip the widget from the DOM and submit. Without this,
    a combo could "pass" because verification isn't wired up at all.
  - *forged token*: solve for real, then corrupt the payload's HMAC signature
    before submitting. Client-side everything looks verified; only the
    server's signature check can catch it.

One suite-wide extra negative (on the core-comments driver only, because the
server-side check is integration-agnostic): **expired token replay** — solve
with `openporte_expires=2`, capture the token, detach the widget (a live one
auto-refetches expired challenges), submit the stale token after the validity
window, expect rejection.

Drivers: WordPress core comments, Contact Form 7, wpDiscuz, WPForms Lite,
WooCommerce login, WooCommerce registration. The third WooCommerce surface
(reset password) is not driven: it shares the registration code path (render
hook + a `*_post` filter) but its happy path ends in an email the mailer-less
bench can't observe.

Real browser, real PoW solving (no mocks): the widget genuinely computes the
challenge, so this also catches timing regressions like the complexity-range
change that exposed the wpDiscuz race.

## The replay-limit suite (`replay-limit.spec.js`)

A second spec file, on its own axis: not "does one solved token work" but
"what happens when the *same* token comes back" (issue #101). Five tests, each
restoring `openporte_replaylimit` afterwards:

- **spends the whole budget, then refuses the next replay** — limit 3 on core
  comments: the solved token is accepted three times across three separate
  requests, and refused on the fourth.
- **refuses the first replay when the limit is strict** — limit 1.
- **accepts unlimited replays when the limit is 0** — the documented escape
  hatch (pre-1.29 behaviour). Guards against the counter becoming
  unconditional.
- **accepts an AJAX resubmission of the same token** — Contact Form 7, limit 5.
  The page never navigates, so this is the real shape of a visitor correcting a
  field and resubmitting: same token, three times, all accepted.
- **still logs a user in when the limit is strict** — the highest-harm
  regression this feature could cause. WordPress and WooCommerce both register
  an `authenticate` callback at priority 20, kept mutually exclusive only by a
  WooCommerce nonce check (see AGENTS.md); if that guard slipped, or anything
  else verified twice in one request, a limit of 1 would lock every user out.
  WooCommerce is activated deliberately so both callbacks are registered, the
  login must succeed, and the token it consumed must then fail to replay.

Replays are posted the way a bot would: fresh page, widget detached, the
captured token re-injected as a bare hidden field (`captureWidgetToken()` /
`injectToken()` in `helpers.js`).

The **arithmetic** of the counter — limits, TTLs, memoisation, fail-open — is
covered far more cheaply by the PHPUnit unit suite (`tests/phpunit`, run with
`npm run test:unit` from the repo root). What only a browser can prove, and
what this file is for, is that one visitor's click costs exactly one use.

> **Not covered here: concurrency.** The counter is meant to be atomic because
> InnoDB row-locks the guarded UPDATE. Demonstrating that needs parallel workers
> against a real database, which neither this suite (one worker, by design) nor
> the unit suite (single process, fake `$wpdb`) can do. For v1.29.0 the property
> is **verified by design** — the acceptance record walks the argument link by
> link — and the empirical test is deferred to #102. Until that lands, treat
> atomicity as reasoned, not measured.

## Prerequisites

Read also tests/README.md to understand how to use the bench and
docs/maintenance-testing.md to have an overview of the testing approach.

1. A running bench: `./wp-env.sh start` (from the repo root; provisions
   fixtures via `tests/bin/wp-init.sh` — the CF7 driver relies on its
   "Contact Us" page, the WPForms driver on its "WPForms Test" page).
   **OpenPorte must be activated** on the bench
   (`./wp-env.sh run cli -- wp plugin activate openporte`) — the init script
   never activates it (a fresh bench starts with it deactivated, for the
   migration test).
2. Reachability: the suite talks to `WP_BASE_URL`
   (default `http://localhost:8888`). For the remote Docker host, either use
   `WP_BASE_URL=http://<remote-host>:8888` or an SSH tunnel
   (`ssh -f -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@remote`).
3. Fixtures from `tests/bin/wp-init.sh` — the core-comments post and Contact
   Form 7's "Contact Us" page. The replay-limit suite uses both, and creates
   its own `e2e-replay-user` (an editor, so a successful login lands somewhere
   assertable).
4. wp-cli bridge: settings are flipped between tests via
   `./wp-env.sh run cli -- wp option …` (default). Override with
   `WP_CLI_CMD="wp-env run cli -- wp"` for a local wp-env.
5. Node ≥ 18. Then:

```sh
cd tests/e2e
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Running

```sh
cd tests/e2e
npm test                                       # everything, all drivers
MATRIX_DRIVERS=wpdiscuz npm test               # one integration
npx playwright test --grep "onsubmit"          # one mode across drivers
npx playwright test replay-limit.spec.js       # just the replay-limit suite
npm run test:headed                            # watch it
npm run report                                 # open the HTML report
```

Tests run **serially with one worker** — the settings under test are global
WordPress options.

## `widget-binding.spec.js` — no bench required

One spec in this directory does *not* talk to wp-env. `widget-binding.spec.js`
serves its own fixture page through a route interceptor, loads the real
`public/script.js`, and stands a minimal stub in for the ALTCHA widget:

```sh
cd tests/e2e
npx playwright test widget-binding.spec.js   # runs anywhere, ~2s, no bench
```

It covers the one thing the matrix structurally cannot see: a widget inserted
into a form *after* page load, as Ninja Forms does when it renders its fields
from Backbone templates. Every click path the matrix drives goes through the
capture-phase click guard, which queries widgets at click time and therefore
works whether or not the per-widget submit listener was ever bound — so an
unbound widget passes the whole matrix and fails only for the visitor, who has
to press Submit twice.

The stub models only the two things `docs/agents/altcha-upstream.md` already
names as the contract to re-check on each widget update — a `.altcha` element
carrying `data-state`, and an `input[type=checkbox]`. Keep it that thin: a
richer stub drifts from the real widget and starts testing itself. The real
widget's behaviour stays the matrix's job.

## Adding an integration

Create `drivers/<name>.js` exporting
`{ key, option, ensure, open, fill, submit, expectAccepted, expectRejected }`
(see `drivers/contact-form-7.js` for the smallest example) and register it in
`drivers/index.js`. `ensure()` runs once per driver: activate the plugin,
create fixtures idempotently, return the context (page path) the other hooks
receive.

## Known caveats

- **wp-cli argument quoting**: `wp-env.sh` forwards commands through
  `ssh "… wp-env $*"`, so the remote shell strips one layer of quoting.
  Values passed to the `wp()` helper must contain no spaces or quotes
  (fixture values are deliberately space-free, e.g. `E2E-Comments`).
- **Comment flood throttle**: core rejects a comment posted within 15 s of
  the previous one from the same IP ("You are posting comments too
  quickly") — every submission here comes from one browser IP, so the
  comment drivers purge the fixture post's comments before each test
  (`driver.reset()`).
- **CF7 acceptance** treats `data-status="failed"` as captcha-accepted: on a
  bench with no mailer the mail send fails *after* the spam check. `spam` is
  the captcha-rejected status. All four visible fields must be filled — the
  default form's Subject is required, and CF7 6.x may block an invalid form
  client-side with the status silently stuck on `init`.
- **Floating UI combos** intentionally use the submit-triggered flow; the
  widget's floating popup positioning is not asserted (only that the
  submission ultimately succeeds). This is the path that caught the
  submit-swallowed-while-verifying bug fixed in `public/script.js`.
- **WooCommerce drivers** share one `[woocommerce_my_account]` fixture page:
  logged out it holds the login form and (once registration is enabled) the
  register form. Each driver zeroes the sibling WooCommerce integration
  options in `ensure()` so exactly one widget renders — the shared helpers
  target `.first()`. The register driver's `reset()` deletes the customers
  its tests created, sparing the login driver's fixture user.
