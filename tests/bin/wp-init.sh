# wp-init.sh — wp-env "afterStart" hook: provision test fixtures for OpenPorte.
#
# Sets up a side-by-side bench so the rebrand/migration can be exercised by hand:
#   * A suite of 3rd-party form plugins (PLUGINS_SUITE below) — installed;
#     only Contact Form 7 is activated (its fixture page needs it). The E2E
#     drivers (tests/e2e) activate the others themselves.
#   * ALTCHA Spam Protection v1.26.3 (the upstream plugin OpenPorte forks) and
#     OpenPorte (this repo, mapped) — both installed; their activation state is
#     never touched (a fresh bench starts with both deactivated), so a tester
#     can activate them one at a time and walk the ALTCHA -> OpenPorte upgrade.
#   * Three pages:
#       - "Contact Us": a Contact Form 7 form (its id is discovered, not guessed).
#       - "WPForms Test": a minimal WPForms fixture form (created as a wpforms
#         CPT post below) rendered via its shortcode.
#       - "Test Page": both the [altcha] and [openporte] shortcodes.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run; existing fixture pages and plugin activation
# states are left untouched.
#
# IMPORTANT: activate ALTCHA and OpenPorte one at a time, never together — both
# register the [altcha] shortcode and the altcha/v1 REST route and would clash.
# The script does not enforce this; keeping them apart is up to the tester.
